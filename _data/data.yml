    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I've been working with Linux and open source for the last 15 years.
      This experience allowed me to span across different software and
      technologies, explore various solutions, and implement creative
      combinations. It has been an incredible and stimulating journey, with
      many challenges and lots of opportunities.

      I've explored many fields of IT: advanced networking, Linux server
      administration, web servers, databases, Samba AD DC, automation with
      Ansible.

      I've been nominated *outstanding member* of the Zimbra forum, participating
      in the evolution of the platform. I closely followed the management of
      CVE-2019-9670 by the community, providing feedback and support to those
      impacted, and developed a script to obtain and install a Letsencrypt
      certificate in Zimbra.

      I also gained strong experience in PHP programming, especially with Yii1.1
      and Yii2 frameworks, developing complex and advanced applications.
      For a big b2c customer, I developed a small Vue app used to prepare
      deliveries, connecting via websocket to a Node.js app continuously reading
      weight from a balance.

      Among the different tasks, I also have been providing I and II level support
      to customers, developing skills to provide the most efficient and proficient
      answer for the client. My broad knowledge in many IT fields allows me to
      understand customer requests better and provide the correct solution.

      I consider myself curious and open-minded. When developing, I focus on
      optimization, speed, and security.

      I always participated in open source, by providing help on forums and
      translating applications, but my first real code contribution was for the F-Spot
      photo management system, a C# based Gnome app.

      For personal growth and career opportunities, I obtained the **SAA-C03
      AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate** certification in May 2023.

          After many years in consultancy, I took a turn to my career by working
          as internal IT for a single company. This allowed me to focus and specialize
          on less topics, but also the chance to widen my expertise by developing in
          Javascript both on frontend and backend, as well as exploring new tools like
          Elasticsearch and Google Cloud.

          Present since the early years, I grew and helped grow the Company,

          knew the name at that time.
          I deployed Linux servers for various purposes, and developed web
          applications with PHP, MySQL, and Apache (later nginx). The internal
          and all the customers' infrastructures are actively monitored with a
          Zabbix installation, which allowed us to promptly prevent and deal
          with possible outages.
          As the company grew, we had the chance to cultivate young talents
          coming from local technical schools and universities.
