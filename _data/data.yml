    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I've been working with Linux and open source for the last 15 years.
      This experience allowed me to span accross different software and
      technologies, explore various solutions and implement creative
      combinations. It has been an incredible and stimulating journey, with
      many challenges and lots of opportunities.
      I've explored many fields of IT: advanced networking, Linux server
      administration, web servers, databases, Samba AD DC, automation with
      Ansible.

        time: 2007 - Present
        company: YetOpen Srl - Italy
        details: |
          Present since the early years, I grew and helped growing the Company,
          developing enterprise solutions with Linux in a country which barely
          knew the name at that time.
          I deployed Linux servers for various purposes, and developed web
          applications with PHP, MySQL and Apache (later nginx). The internal
          and all the customers infrastructures are actively monited with a
          Zabbix installation, which allowed us to promptly prevent and deal
          with possible outages.
          As the company grew, we had the chance to cultivate young talents
          coming from local technical schools and universities.
